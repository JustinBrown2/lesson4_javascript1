### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. JavaScript is case sensitive. If you do not exactly mimic the same case throughout the program it will not run correctly which can be frustrating. 
2. When creating an identifier in JavaScript it can only contain numbers, letter, underscores, and a dollar sign. 
3. To display text we use the document object method document.write() to write a string of text to the browser.
